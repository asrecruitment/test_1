# Programing test 1

Customer requested a new separate module to maintain product informationâ€™s. 
This new module should have REST API to list all active products with EAN number, name and list price. 
Customer did not specify how the API should look like.

Add missing functionality to the existing project:
- Add list price to the Product domain (com.tieto.recruitment.product.Product)
- Create REST service to fetch all active products with EAN, name and list price
- Add tests

Please fork this project and send a pull request with implementation.
Modification of build.gradle file is allowed.
